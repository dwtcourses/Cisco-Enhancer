## What is Cisco Enhancer

Cisco Enhancer is a set of addition options for the agent to ensure maximum ready state compliance and minimum distractions during calls. Featuring **Not Ready** and **Wrap-Up** state reminders and automatic minimization or closure of defined non-work applications or windows. This is an app to be deployed individually, as wanted. Large deployments have not been tested, and are at your own risk.
